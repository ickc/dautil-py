Introduction
============

``dautil`` stands for Data Analysis Utilities. It includes some of the
routines I used for data analysis.

Thereâ€™s a companion repo called ``dautil-sh``, scripts for similar
purpose but use bash instead.

Installation
============

1. ``pip install dautilpy``

2. Optionally add ``bin/`` to your ``PATH``. Consider these some example
   scripts that uses ``dautilpy``.
